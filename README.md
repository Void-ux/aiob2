aiob2 is an asynchronous API wrapper for the [Backblaze B2 Bucket API](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/calling.html).

It will allow you to interact with your B2 bucket, it's files and anything else that the B2 API allows in a modern, object-oriented fashion.

**NOTE:** There are API endpoints left to implement, eventually they will be added. To speed up this process you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Void-ux/aiob2/pulls) or [suggest it](https://github.com/Void-ux/aiob2/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Installation

---

aiob2 is compatible with Python 3.8+ (this is an estimate). To install aiob2, run the following command in your (virtual) environment.

```shell
pip install aiob2
```

Alternatively, for the latest though least stable version, you can download it from the GitHub repo:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Void-ux/aiob2.git
```

## Usage

### Uploading

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

from aiob2 import Client

# Our image to upload to our bucket
with open(r'C:\Users\MS1\Pictures\Camera Roll\IMG_5316.jpeg', 'rb') as file:
    data = file.read()

async def main():
    async with Client('key_id', 'key') as client:
        file = await client.upload_file(
            content_bytes=data,
            file_name='test.jpg',
            bucket_id='bucket_id',
        )


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

And that's it! `upload_file()` returns a `File` object that neatly wraps everything Backblaze's API has provided us with.
The `File` object's documentation can be found [here](https://aiob2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/api.html#aiob2.File)
